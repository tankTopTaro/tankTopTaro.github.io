## BUGS | ISSUES
1. Offcanvas navigation doesn't seem to work as intended. Navigation will scroll back to top as offcanvas navigation is closed(dismiss). {can be fixed by adding the class 'fixed-top' to the navbar.
2. Haven't implemented media queries for landscape in mobile devices. Spacing will be out of whack if you try it on lanscape mode.
